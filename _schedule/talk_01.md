abstract: Responsible decision-making is tough in batch settings because policy improvement involves doing something different from the current behavior policy -- but we only have data from that current behavior policy.  In this talk, I'll first briefly share not only the variety of approaches we have taken to identify better hypotension treatment policies for ICU patients, but also our difficulties in trying to validate them.  Next, I'll describe recent work which focuses on (a) identifying where clinicians disagree and (b) only making recommendations at those decision points.  (The core idea being that, statistically, we only have evidence to suggest an alternate policy in areas where we have observed clinician disagreement.)  The result is a set of recommendations that has both more statistical support and is easier for clinicians to inspect for validity.
