abstract:  An important goal for recommender systems is to make recommendations that maximize some form of user utility, ideally over extended periods of time. While reinforcement learning has started to find limited application in recommendation settings, for the most part, practical recommender systems remain myopic (i.e., focused on immediate user responses rather than long-term user value). Moreover, they are local in the sense that they rarely consider the impact that a recommendation made to one user may have on the ability to serve other users. These latter "ecosystem effects" play a critical role in optimizing long-term user utility. In this talk, I describe an approach to optimizing user utility and social welfare using reinforcement learning and equilibrium modeling of the recommender ecosystem. I will also draw connections between these models and notions such as fairness and incentive design and outline some future challenges for the community.
