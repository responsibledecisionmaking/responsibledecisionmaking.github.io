# Abstract for the papers
abstract: For responsible decision making in safety-critical settings, machine learning models must effectively detect and process edge-case data. Al- though existing works show that predictive un- certainty is useful for these tasks, it is not evident from literature which uncertainty-aware models are best suited for a given dataset. Thus, we com- pare six uncertainty-aware deep learning models on a set of edge-case tasks - robustness to adversarial attacks as well as out-of-distribution and adversarial detection. We find that the geometry of the data sub-manifold is an important factor in determining the success of various models. Our finding suggests an interesting direction in the study of uncertainty-aware deep learning models
