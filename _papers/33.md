# Abstract for the papers
abstract: Trees are widely used as interpretable models. However, when they are greedily trained they can yield suboptimal predictive performance. Train- ing soft trees, with probabilistic splits rather than deterministic, provides a way to globally optimize tree models. For interpretability purposes, a hard tree can be obtained from a soft tree by binarizing the probabilistic splits, called hardening. Unfortunately, the good performance of the soft model is often lost after hardening. We systemmatically study two factors contributing to the performance drop and show that simple mitigation methods in literature do not fully address these issues.
