I"q<p>We will invite speakers and solicit contributed papers and posters spanning the entire range of responsible sequential decision making  (fairness, private and interpretable algorithm design, reinforcement learning).</p>

<p>We expect that the presence of these different communities will result in a fruitful exchange of ideas and stimulate an open discussion about the current challenges and possible solutions.</p>

<p>In terms of prospective participants, our main targets are machine learning researchers interested in discussing the metrics (e.g., fairness and privacy), understanding the issues and/or limitations of the current paradigm and algorithms and in providing novel solutions. Specific target communities within machine learning include, but are not limited to fairness and ethics, privacy, economics, optimization, deep learning and reinforcement learning.</p>
